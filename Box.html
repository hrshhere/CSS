    <h3><u>Waht is Box Model ?</u></h3>
    <p>The CSS Box Model is a fundamental concept that describes how elements are structured and sized in a web page layout. It consists of several layers or components, which together determine the overall size and spacing of an HTML element. Understanding the box model is crucial for controlling the layout and appearance of elements on a webpage. Here's an overview of the key components of the CSS Box Model:</p>

    <h5>1.Content: </h5>
    <p>This is the innermost layer of the box and represents the actual content of the HTML element, such as text, images, or other media.</p>

    <h5>2.Padding:</h5>
    <p>Padding is the space between the content and the element's border. It can be controlled using the padding property and can be different for each side (e.g., padding-top, padding-right, padding-bottom, and padding-left). Padding adds space within the element's border.</p>

    <h5>3.Border</h5>
    <p>The border surrounds the padding and content. It is defined using the border property, which can specify its width, style, and color. You can control different sides of the border using properties like border-top, border-right, border-bottom, and border-left.</p>

    <h5>4.Margin:</h5>
    <p>Margin is the space outside the element's border, creating separation between the element and neighboring elements. You can control margins using the margin property and specify different values for each side (e.g., margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom, and margin-left).</p>

    <Strong>Here's an example of how the CSS Box Model works:</Strong>
    <br>
    (
        .box {
            width: 200px;          /* Width of the content area */
            <br>
            height: 100px;         /* Height of the content area */
            <br>
            padding: 20px;         /* Padding around the content area */
            <br>
            border: 2px solid #333; /* Border width, style, and color */
            <br>
            margin: 10px;          /* Margin space outside the border */
        }
    )
        <br>
    <span>In this example, if you have an HTML element with the class box, the total width and height of the element, including content, padding, border, and margin, would be:</span>
